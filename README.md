# Python Business Automation

A growing collection of small, purposeful Python scripts built from pseudocode logic to automate common business workflows — from email formatting to data tracking.

## 🎯 Purpose

Each script begins as pseudocode to outline the problem-solving logic, then evolves into a working Python automation.  
This approach demonstrates structured thinking, clean logic, and practical coding skills.
